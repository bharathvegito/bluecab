# Introduction #

This wiki talks about how to set up the development environment for the blue cab project. Most of the development is done with Eclipse Ganymede IDE. We will need svn client and svn connector to work with the svn repository. For the bluetooth api J2ME is required which is installed through 'eclipseme' website. After these are done wireless toolkit library has to be imported into the project. I will try to make as many jar files available in the repository or insert links to get them here if former is not possible.
